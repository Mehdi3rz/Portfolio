Hey there! I’m Mehdi, a passionate Machine Learning & AI enthusiast currently pursuing my graduate studies. I love exploring different aspects of ML, from classic algorithms to deep learning techniques.

This repo contains some of my coursework, experiments, and fun side projects, covering:
✅ Supervised Learning – Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes
✅ Unsupervised Learning – PCA, LDA, Image Segmentation
✅ Sequence Modeling – Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
✅ Ensemble Learning – Boosting & Bagging techniques
✅ Deep Learning & Image Processing – Image Classification & Segmentation

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and discussing new ideas. Let’s connect!
